<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project is a **responsive web application** designed to showcase a set of guidelines, checklists, and testimonials in a clean and user-friendly interface. It provides a structured approach to displaying content, while ensuring that the layout adjusts appropriately on various screen sizes.

### What I Learned

- **Responsive Web Design**: Through the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience in making a website responsive. Using media queries, I created layouts that adjust for both small devices (like mobile phones) and large devices (like desktop computers).

  For example, I learned how to optimize text size, adjust container widths, and position elements properly using Flexbox and CSS Grid.

- **UI/UX Design**: I applied best practices for user-centered design by organizing content into easy-to-navigate sections. I used visual cues like icons, proper font choices, and spacing to enhance readability and usability.

- **CSS Customization**: I worked extensively with CSS custom properties (variables) to manage color schemes and typography across the project. This approach not only made the code more maintainable but also ensured that the design was consistent.

- **Branding & Aesthetics**: I gained a better understanding of brand representation through design. I added brand logos, adjusted colors, and used icons to create a professional yet approachable aesthetic.

- **Performance Optimization**: I improved the performance by utilizing clean and minimal code, optimizing images, and ensuring that CSS selectors are efficient.

### Useful Resources
